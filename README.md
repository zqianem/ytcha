## Installation

Requires [Deno](https://deno.com/), for now; adjust `--output` as needed:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zqianem/ytcha
cd ytcha
deno install --quiet
deno compile --allow-all --output $HOME/.local/bin/ytcha ./index.ts
```

Might make this installable via NPM later.

## Why

The Formula 1 channel kept putting out videos with titles that would spoil the
outcome of their highlights (e.g. Max Verstappen's Qualifying Lap), so I made
this so I could run:

```sh
ytcha formula1 | rg highlights
```

where `rg` is [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) with
`--smart-case` enabled by default in config.
