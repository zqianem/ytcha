# ytcha

A CLI to scape a list of recent videos from a specific YouTube channel to allow
them to be piped to tools like `grep` and `jq`.

See `ytcha --help` for details.

## Demo

## Installation

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh), for now; adjust `--outfile` as needed:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zqianem/ytcha
cd ytcha
bun build ./index.ts --compile --outfile ~/.local/bin/ytcha
```

Might make this installable via NPM later.

## Why

The Formula 1 channel kept putting out videos with titles that would spoil the
outcome of their highlights (e.g. Max Verstappen's Qualifying Lap), so I made
this so I could run:

```sh
ytcha formula1 | rg highlights
```

where `rg` is [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) with
`--smart-case` enabled by default in config.
